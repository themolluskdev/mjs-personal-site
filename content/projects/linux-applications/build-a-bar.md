This polybar builder GUI application built with GTK3. The purpose of this application is because I would spend a good chunk of time trying to match other rice configs I would see on r/unixporn. While creating Polybar themes are not too complicated, in the same way writing bare HTML and CSS can time consuming I felt that there can be a slightly faster way to go about it. Inspired by drag and drop website creators such as GoDaddy and WebFlow, Build-A-Bar allows users to take building block components and create a quick and pretty polybar in a few moments based of whatever build picture you see. After completing the bar, users can download there bar configs files and start them up in their wm or dt of choice.
