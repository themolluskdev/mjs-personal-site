This is a web application for easy and simple AR intergration without the need for a lot of knowledge of augmented reality. This built with the AR.js, and gives users the
ability to upload their own 3D models in .glb format, and view thier models using a generated QR code. Users can also browse other user submitted 3D models to interact with user model assigned QR codes as well.
